Les Residences / Residencies
----------------------------

**Cette partie du wiki est en Anglais car les residences ont été réalisées à l'etranger. // All these pages are in English because all residencies were performed outside of France.**

On these pages is the documentation about the residencies performed in different fablabs around the Earth.
Residencies are of different amount of times (days or month).

Verona Fablab
+++++++++++++

At around 10km from Verona in Italy, at Grezzana, you'll find in the following the documentation on all projects performed during a residency of 2 month during summer 2019.
This residency happens because of the program Inn Veneto.

Pralnia
+++++++

During Jully 2019, for a week I participated to a mini maker week in Pralnia, the makerspace at Sokolowsko in Poland. During the week, I performed a workshop on inkscape basics and started the development of a project on a connected plant Deedo. You'll have in the following only the documentation on this project.
