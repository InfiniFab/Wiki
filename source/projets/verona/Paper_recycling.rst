Recycling paper
===============


In this page we'll try to explain the different steps to recycle paper and different kind of natural material to produce paper.
This manual has been produced after an interview with Sonia from `CartaMuriel <https://www.facebook.com/cartamuriel/>`_

Material Used for recycling
---------------------------

Before producing, the chose of the material to be recycled is crucial and will define the quality and aspect of the paper produced.
The proportion of the different material used will also change the aspect of the paper produced.
In the following are note on the different material that can or can't be used.

- Basic Paper : Any paper, from magazine, newspaper or book can be used if its only paper composed.

.. note : plastified paper from some magazin can't be used, it would depreciate quality of recyled paper

- cardboard : can be used
- wood : can be used if reduced to powder
- cord
- flower petal : can be used to add texture to the paper. Needs to be soak for at least 24h otherwise color of the petals will difuse irregulary on the recycled paper.
- cellulose : Classic material used as basis for normal paper, can be used for more strong paper.


The Process
-----------

In this part are expleined the different steps to respect in produce recycled paper

1- Preparing the Material to be recycled
****************************************

Before forming the pulp that will compose the recycled paper, the material to be recycled needs to be prepared, this means reduced in **small pieces** or **powder** , depending on the material, that will be integrated into the pulp.

2- Preparing the pulp
*********************

In Verona Fablab, we used a `dedicated device that will mixture paper, water and glue. <https://www.eifeltor-muehle.de/papiermacherprodukte/werkzeuge-verschiedenes/#cc-m-product-12208529024>`_.

**1rst we add the paper in about 20L water**

  In about 20L of water, we add the paper pieces

.. note :: The quantity of paper added depends on the aspect wanted on the recycled paper (thickness, strentgh,...)

**then we add about 5cl of glue to the mixture**

  wood glue that works for recycled paper

  glue dedicated for paper making, works well with cellulose paper

**Add about a spoon of calcium carbonate**

.. note :: calcium carbonate is used to allow paper to be used in jet-ink printer after

**Mix until having the desired pulp texture**

  a fine texture will make more homogenous paper

3- Paper forming
****************

After the paper pulp is made, this is the moment to form the recycled paper based on the pulp.

**Put the pulp in a flat recipient**

**Choose the mold and deckle that will decide the texture and shape of the recycled paper**

  different size of mold that will separate the pulp from the water

.. figure :: ../../_static/paper/IMG_20190806_122319666.jpg

  deckle can come in different shape and size

**Put the deckle on the mold and dive both into the mixture**

**Shake gently and keeping the mold and deckle horizontaly**

**separate the deckle from the mold**

**Put the formed paper on absorbant paper**

**Perform a pile of paper with an absorbant paper between each**

.. figure :: ../../_static/paper/IMG_20190808_103423567.jpg

  type of absorbant paper that can be used

**Press the pile to remove excess of water**

**Remove paper from absorbant**

**Leave the paper to dry 24h**

**To have a more smooth effect on the paper, you can use a hot press for about 20 secondes**
