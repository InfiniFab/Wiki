The Duke - Boardgame to be laser cut
====================================


Directly issue from a strategy board game "The Duke" [#f1]_ .
All rules and graphic element are free to be used for playing, so I got the PDF for the tiles. converted them into vectorial design and exported them into DXF for the laser cut.


The base game source
--------------------

2 SVG files for produce game tiles

1 SVG file for the board

The production process
----------------------

Process is pretty basic, for one army, engrave faces of tiles on one face, cut around the whole tiles. turn the wood plate by keeping in place the frame, then engrave the other sides of the faces to finally cut each tiles.

You can find the vectorial files in the `thingiverse deicated page <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3762781>`_
